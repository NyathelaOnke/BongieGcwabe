                            I have been a Social Worker and a Wellness Specialist for more than thirty years, and have
                            assisted my clients to deal appropriately with different challenges that impact negatively in
                            their lives, in order to improve their well-being. <br><br>
                            <em><b> Coaching </b></em> <br><br>
                            I have also discovered that there are people that present themselves for counselling, believing
                            they have psycho-social or emotional challenges, struggling to align their goals personally,
                            and professionally with those of their organisations. Something that results in uncertainty and
                            despair. These people tend to benefit more from coaching, a service I also provide. <br><br>
                            My coaching process involves identifying your strengths and opportunities, to navigate through your goals. A client-centred coaching framework is applied throughout this process. 
                            If I have never been on the same path with you, I use questioning techniques that emanate from a curious mind that is free from biases, to assist you to achieve your goals. Through coaching, hope is certain.<br><br>
                            My consultations are face-to-face and virtual (Telephone and Zoom/Skype/Microsoft Teams). I am based in Pretoria, South Africa. <br> <br>

                            professional with considerable experience in a people development field.
                            I have been in the Employee Health and Wellness Field for more than three decades at both Provincial and National
                            levels. This has been an opportunity to broaden my understanding in Human Resource Management and Development functions,
                            as well as relevant Legislations and Frameworks. <br><br>
                            My work experience and training have enabled me to expand my understanding of service delivery
                            processes and empowered me to develop and master a number of skills and competencies which are
                            essential in rendering an effective and efficient service within a public sector and in partnership with
                            private sectors at strategic levels. <br><br>
                            I presented a paper at the Employee Assistance Professionals Association – South Africa (EAPA-SA) conference on the effectiveness of Telephone Counselling in the Public Sector.
                            The invite came after the component I was managing was identified as having the best practice in this area.
                            I have since guided and advised wellness practitioners across the country on providing virtual health and wellness support
                            to their clientele during the COVID-19 period and lockdown.
